    "**1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions offer several advantages in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reusability**: Functions allow you to write a piece of code once and reuse it multiple times throughout the program, reducing redundancy and simplifying maintenance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Modularity**: Functions help break down complex programs into smaller, manageable chunks. Each function can focus on a specific task, making the code easier to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstraction**: Functions abstract away details, so the user doesn't need to understand how a function works to use it. This simplifies interactions with the code and helps in focusing on higher-level logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Easier Testing and Debugging**: Testing becomes more efficient because you can test individual functions in isolation. If something goes wrong, it's easier to pinpoint the issue within a specific function rather than in a large block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Maintainability**: When functions are well-structured and isolated, they make the codebase easier to maintain. If a change is required, you can update a function without having to modify the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Namespace Management**: Functions help avoid variable name conflicts by creating a local scope for variables, preventing accidental overwrites in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Improved Readability**: Functions with descriptive names make code more readable, allowing other developers (or even you) to understand the purpose of the code without needing to read through every line."

    "- **Defining a function**: When you define a function, you're essentially telling the program what the function does, but the function's code isn't executed at that point.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Calling a function**: The code inside the function only runs when you invoke (call) the function in your program. At that time, the program jumps to the function, executes the code inside it, and then returns to the point where the function was called."

    "**4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function**:\n",
    "   - A **function** is a block of code that is defined to perform a specific task.\n",
    "   - It is created using the `def` statement in Python.\n",
    "   - A function includes a name, a body (the code that executes when the function is called), and optionally parameters (inputs).\n",
    "   - Defining a function does not execute its code; it simply tells the program what to do when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of defining a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def greet(name):\n",
    "       print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Call**:\n",
    "   - A **function call** is when you invoke or execute the function that has been defined.\n",
    "   - The function call triggers the execution of the code inside the function’s body.\n",
    "   - When calling a function, you can pass arguments (values) to it if it takes parameters.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example of calling the function:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Global Scope**:\n",
    "   - There is **one global scope** in a Python program.\n",
    "   - The global scope is the top-level scope, where variables and functions are defined outside of any function or class.\n",
    "   - Any variable defined in the global scope is accessible throughout the program, including within functions (unless shadowed by a local variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of global scope:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 10  \n",
    "\n",
    "   def example():\n",
    "       print(x)  \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local Scopes**:\n",
    "   - There are **multiple local scopes** in a Python program.\n",
    "   - A local scope exists within each function (or method), and any variable defined inside a function is local to that function.\n",
    "   - Each function has its own local scope, which means variables defined in one function are not accessible in another function unless passed as arguments or returned.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example of local scope:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def example():\n",
    "       y = 5  \n",
    "       print(y)  \n",

    "2. Once the function completes and **returns**, the local variables are **no longer accessible**. The memory they occupied is freed, and their values are discarded.\n",
    "3. Any attempt to access a local variable after the function has returned will result in an error, as it no longer exists.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Concept of a Return Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **return value** in Python is the value that a function produces when it finishes executing and sends back to the caller. The `return` statement is used to specify the return value, and once the function returns a value, the function call is replaced with that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a function doesn't explicitly use a `return` statement, it returns `None` by default.\n",
    "- The value returned by the function can be any valid Python data type (integer, string, list, object, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b  \n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(3, 5) \n",
    "print(result)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Return Value in an Expression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is possible to use a return value in an expression. The return value of a function can be part of any expression just like any other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def multiply(x, y):\n",
    "    return x * y\n",

    "**8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function does not have a `return` statement, the return value of a call to that function is **`None`** by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when a function is executed and there is no `return` statement, the function implicitly returns `None` after completing its execution.\n",

    "- When the function is called, it returns `None` by default, and that value is assigned to the `result` variable.\n",
    "- `print(result)` outputs `None` because that's what the function returns when no `return` statement is provided.\n",

    "**9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a function variable refer to a **global variable**, you can use the `global` keyword inside the function. This allows you to modify the global variable directly from within the function, rather than creating a new local variable with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Use the `global` keyword followed by the name of the variable that you want to refer to and modify.\n",
    "2. This tells Python that you want to use the global variable, not a local one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "x = 10  \n",
