        "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a child class to inherit the properties and methods of parent class. This mechanism promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses:\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Changes in the parent class automatically apply to all child classes, making it easier to maintain and update code.\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Inheritance enables polymorphism, where a single interface can represent different underlying data types."
