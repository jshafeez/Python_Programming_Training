    "### Q.1. **What are keywords in Python? Using the keyword library, print all the Python keywords.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords in Python are reserved words that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names). They are part of the Python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To print all Python keywords using the `keyword` library:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print all Python keywords\n",
    "print(keyword.kwlist)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q.2. **What are the rules to create variables in Python?**\n",
    "In Python, the rules for creating variable names are as follows:\n",
    "1. Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "2. The rest of the variable name can include letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.\n",
    "3. Variable names are case-sensitive (`variable` is different from `Variable`).\n",
    "4. Variable names cannot be Python keywords (e.g., `if`, `class`, `return`).\n",
    "5. They should not contain spaces.\n",
    "6. Variable names should be meaningful, reflecting the value they hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q.3. **What are the standards and conventions followed for the nomenclature of variables in Python to improve code readability and maintainability?**\n",
    "- **Snake case**: For variable and function names, use all lowercase letters with words separated by underscores (`my_variable`).\n",
    "- **CapWords**: For class names, use CapitalizedWords (also known as PascalCase) without underscores (`MyClass`).\n",
    "- **Constants**: Use all uppercase letters with words separated by underscores (`MY_CONSTANT`).\n",
    "- **Avoid single-character variable names** (except for counters or iterators in loops).\n",
    "- **Be descriptive**: Use meaningful names to make the code self-explanatory.\n",
    "- **Avoid using Python keywords or built-in function names**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q.4. **What will happen if a keyword is used as a variable name?**\n",
    "If a keyword is used as a variable name, Python will raise a **SyntaxError** because keywords are reserved words that have a specific meaning in the language. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if = 10  # SyntaxError: cannot assign to keyword\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q.5. **For what purpose is the `def` keyword used?**\n",
    "The `def` keyword is used to define a function in Python. It is followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and a block of code that defines the function's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q.6. **What is the operation of this special character ‘\\’?**\n",
    "The backslash `\\` is an escape character in Python. It is used to introduce special characters or sequences within strings. It signals that the next character should be treated differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common uses**:\n",
    "- `\\n`: Newline\n",
    "- `\\t`: Tab\n",
    "- `\\\\`: A literal backslash\n",
    "- `\\'`: Single quote in a string delimited by single quotes\n",
    "- `\\\"`: Double quote in a string delimited by double quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello\\nWorld\")  # Outputs:\n",
    "# Hello\n",
    "# World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q.7. **Give an example of the following conditions:**\n",
    "(i) **Homogeneous List**: A list containing elements of the same type.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "homogeneous_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # All elements are integers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) **Heterogeneous Set**: A set containing elements of different types.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "heterogeneous_set = {1, \"Hello\", 3.14, True}  # Mixed data types\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) **Homogeneous Tuple**: A tuple containing elements of the same type.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "homogeneous_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # All elements are integers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q.8. **Explain the mutable and immutable data types with proper explanation & examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable data types**: These are data types whose values can be changed after they are created.\n",
    "  - Examples: Lists, Sets, Dictionaries\n",
    "  - **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    my_list[0] = 10  # The list is modified\n",
    "    print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable data types**: These are data types whose values cannot be changed after they are created.\n",
    "  - Examples: Strings, Tuples, Integers, Floats\n",
    "  - **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "    # my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError because tuples are immutable\n",
    "    print(my_tuple)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q.9. **Write a code to create the given structure using only a `for` loop:**\n",
