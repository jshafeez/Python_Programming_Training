    "1. **Primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**\n",
    "   The primary goal of OOP is to organize and structure code in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions. It achieves this by creating **objects** (instances of **classes**) that encapsulate both **data** (attributes) and **functions** (methods) that operate on that data. OOP aims to promote code reuse, modularity, and easier maintenance by organizing code into self-contained units (classes and objects) and supporting concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object in Python:**\n",
    "   An object in Python is an instance of a class. It is a collection of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data. Objects are created by calling the class as a constructor, and they allow you to work with the attributes and methods defined in the class.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, model, year):\n",
    "           self.model = model\n",
    "           self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_car = Car('Toyota', 2020)  \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Class in Python:**\n",
    "   A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that will be shared by all instances of the class. A class encapsulates behavior (methods) and state (attributes) into a single unit. The class serves as a template for creating individual objects.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, model, year):\n",
    "           self.model = model\n",
    "           self.year = year\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Attributes and Methods in a class:**\n",
    "   - **Attributes**: These are variables that store data associated with the object or class. They represent the state or properties of the object.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Car:\n",
    "         def __init__(self, model, year):\n",
    "             self.model = model  # attribute\n",
    "             self.year = year    # attribute\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Methods**: These are functions that define the behavior of the object. Methods operate on the object's attributes and can perform actions or computations.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Car:\n",
    "         def start_engine(self):  # method\n",
    "             print(f\"{self.model}'s engine is now running!\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Difference between class variables and instance variables in Python:**\n",
    "   - **Instance variables** are specific to an instance of the class (i.e., an object). Each object has its own copy of the instance variables.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Car:\n",
    "         def __init__(self, model, year):\n",
    "             self.model = model  # instance variable\n",
    "             self.year = year    # instance variable\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Class variables** are shared among all instances of the class. They are not tied to any specific object, and their values are the same for every instance of the class.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Car:\n",
    "         wheels = 4  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Purpose of the `self` parameter in Python class methods:**\n",
    "   The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used within instance methods to access the instance's attributes and other methods. It allows each instance of the class to store its own state and differentiate between different objects.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, model, year):\n",
    "           self.model = model\n",
    "           self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "       def display_info(self):\n",
    "           print(f\"Car model: {self.model}, Year: {self.year}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   When calling a method on an object, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument (which is `self`), so you donâ€™t need to pass it explicitly."
