    "### Ques-1. **Role of the 'else' block in a `try-except` statement**:\n",
    "The `else` block in a `try-except` statement is executed if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. It allows you to define code that should run only when no error occurs, ensuring that error handling is separated from normal flow logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario**:\n",
    "If you’re reading from a file and only want to process the file's contents if it’s read successfully, you can use the `else` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"File content successfully read:\")\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()  \n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the `else` block runs if the file is opened and read successfully, and the `except` block handles any `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-2. **Can a `try-except` block be nested inside another `try-except` block?**\n",
    "Yes, a `try-except` block can be nested inside another `try-except` block. This is useful when you want to handle errors at different levels or specific types of errors in different parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    a = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = 10 / a\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"Result is {result}\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input, please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-3. **How to create a custom exception class in Python**:\n",
    "You can create a custom exception by subclassing Python's built-in `Exception` class. This is useful when you want to define specific errors for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise MyCustomError(\"Something went wrong with the operation.\")\n",
    "except MyCustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Custom error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-4. **Common Built-in Exceptions in Python**:\n",
    "- **ValueError**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but inappropriate value.\n",
    "- **TypeError**: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "- **IndexError**: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range.\n",
    "- **KeyError**: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "- **FileNotFoundError**: Raised when trying to open a file that doesn’t exist.\n",
    "- **ZeroDivisionError**: Raised when dividing by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-5. **What is logging in Python and why is it important in software development?**\n",
    "Logging in Python is the practice of recording messages that provide insights into the execution of a program. It's crucial for monitoring, debugging, and maintaining applications, as it helps developers understand program flow and track issues in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-6. **Purpose of Log Levels in Python Logging**:\n",
    "Log levels help categorize log messages by importance. Python's logging module supports different log levels:\n",
    "- **DEBUG**: Detailed information, useful for diagnosing problems.\n",
    "- **INFO**: Informational messages, indicating normal operation.\n",
    "- **WARNING**: Indicates that something unexpected happened but the program is still running.\n",
    "- **ERROR**: Indicates a more serious issue, often a failure in the program’s logic.\n",
    "- **CRITICAL**: A very severe error that might cause the program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.debug(\"This is a debug message.\")\n",
    "logging.info(\"This is an info message.\")\n",
    "logging.warning(\"This is a warning message.\")\n",
    "logging.error(\"This is an error message.\")\n",
    "logging.critical(\"This is a critical message.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-7. **Log Formatters in Python Logging**:\n",
    "A log formatter defines the structure of log messages. You can customize the log format using the `logging.Formatter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create logger\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(\"my_logger\")\n",
    "logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create handler\n",
    "handler = logging.FileHandler(\"my_app.log\")\n",
    "handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create formatter\n",
    "formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add handler to logger\n",
    "logger.addHandler(handler)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log a message\n",
    "logger.info(\"This is an info message with a custom format.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-8. **Capturing Log Messages from Multiple Modules or Classes**:\n",
    "To capture log messages from multiple modules, you should configure logging in a central module, then import and use the logger in other modules. This ensures that all logs are handled consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# main.py\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "import module1\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "module1.function1()\n",
    "\n",
    "# module1.py\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "def function1():\n",
    "    logging.info(\"This is a log message from module1.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-9. **Difference Between Logging and Print Statements**:\n",
    "- **Logging**: Provides more control over message levels, output destinations (file, console, etc.), and message formatting. It can be easily configured to capture logs from different parts of the application and in production.\n",
    "- **Print**: Primarily used for debugging and displaying outputs to the console. It's less flexible and doesn't provide levels or persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use logging over print**:\n",
    "Use logging in production or when you need to track errors, exceptions, or detailed information over time, and print statements should be reserved for quick debugging during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-10. **Python Program to Log \"Hello, World!\" to \"app.log\" with INFO level**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.INFO, filemode='a', format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log message\n",
    "logging.info(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This program appends the log message with INFO level to the file `app.log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ques-11. **Program to Log an Error Message to Console and \"errors.log\" if an Exception Occurs**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up logging to console and file\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger()\n",
    "logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Console handler\n",
    "console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n",
    "console_handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n",
    "\n",
    "# File handler\n",
    "file_handler = logging.FileHandler('errors.log')\n",
    "file_handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Formatter\n",
    "formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add handlers to logger\n",
    "logger.addHandler(console_handler)\n",
    "logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example code to raise an error\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    1 / 0  # Division by zero\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    logger.error(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "```"
